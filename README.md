Windows Scripts
===============

This is my collection of scripts I've written for Windows.  They control various things such as my Windows Hotkeys, WSL, backups, and game saves.

Be sure to add the `scripts` directory to the Windows `PATH`.

The `WSL` scripts rely upon `SystemTrayRefresh.exe` to get rid of non-working icons.  It can be downloaded [here](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/system_tray_refresh.html).

This is my attempt to preserve them forever.
